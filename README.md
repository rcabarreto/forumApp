## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node installed to run this project, 

````
$ cd ~
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
````

Check installation

````

I made deployment using docker-compose, but before starting, you should add the following to your hosts file.
