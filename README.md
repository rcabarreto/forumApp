# Simple Forum App

A very simple and small forum web app

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node installed to run this project, 

````
$ cd ~
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
````

Check installation

````
$ node -v
````

````
Output
v8.0.0
````

### Installing

First, download the project, then cd into the project, install dependencies and start the application.

````
$ git glone https://github.com/rcabarreto/forumApp.git forumApp/
$ cd forumApp/
$ npm install
$ npm start
````

After the app starts, you can access it on your web browser.

````
http://localhost:3000
````

## Development

For development, you should use some plugin like uglifyjs to minimize the js files. On Dev mode, the default database will be SQLite and the file will be created on the data folder. 

## Deployment

I created a Dockerfile to containerize this project making it easy to deploy to a production environment. In production the system uses a production grade database, in this case is MySQL. It also uses a NGINX as proxy server. See docker-compose for more details on the infrastructure.

If you want to try the Docker deployment, just add the following to your hosts file.
````
127.0.0.1    www.forumapp.com app.forumapp.com pma.forumapp.com
````

Then just cd into the project and run

````
$ docker-compose up
````
